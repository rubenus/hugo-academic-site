abstract: Polarization arises when the underlying network connecting the members
  of a community or society becomes characterized by highly connected groups
  with weak intergroup connectivity. The increasing polarization, the
  strengthening of echo chambers, and the isolation caused by information
  filters in social networks are increasingly attracting the attention of
  researchers from different areas of knowledge such as computer science,
  economics, and social and political sciences. This work presents an annotated
  review of network polarization measures and models used to handle the
  polarization. Several approaches for measuring polarization in graphs and
  networks were identified, including those based on homophily, modularity,
  random walks, and balance theory. The strategies used for reducing
  polarization include methods that propose edge or node editions (including
  insertions or deletions as well as edge weight modifications), changes in
  social network design, or changes in the recommendation systems embedded in
  these networks.
