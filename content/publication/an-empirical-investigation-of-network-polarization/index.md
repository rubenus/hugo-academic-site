abstract: This paper proposes and explores a new quantitative characterization
  of the polarization phenomenon in networks. We first characterize the
  homophily of each node individually. We depart from the definition of a new
  measure of the homophily of the nodes of a network, and we consider the
  homophily distribution over the nodes as a primary indicator of the strength
  of polarization. Next, to address the polarization of the network as a whole,
  a probabilistic approach is developed. The approach is based on the
  straightforward computation of empirical cumulative distribution functions of
  sampled data from the network. These empirical distributions provide a more
  insightful understanding of the status of the network. They may be used not
  only to compare the polarization of groups of nodes or entire networks, but
  also to estimate the impacts of external interventions in terms of node
  polarization. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated in several case
  studies associated with real-life data sets from different sources.
