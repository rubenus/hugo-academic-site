abstract: The erosion of social cohesion and polarization is one of the topmost
  societal risks. In this work, we investigated the evolution of polarization,
  influence, and domination in online interaction networks using a large Twitter
  dataset collected before and during the 2022 Brazilian elections. From a
  theoretical perspective, we develop a methodology called d-modularity that
  allows discovering the contribution of specific groups to network polarization
  using the well-known modularity measure. While the overall network modularity
  (somewhat unexpectedly) decreased, the proposed group-oriented approach
  reveals that the contribution of the right-leaning community to this
  modularity increased, remaining very high during the analyzed period. Our
  methodology is general enough to be used in any situation when the
  contribution of specific groups to overall network modularity and polarization
  is needed to investigate. Moreover, using the concept of partial domination,
  we are able to compare the reach of sets of influential profiles from
  different groups and their ability to accomplish coordinated communication
  inside their groups and across segments of the entire network. We show that in
  the whole network, the left-leaning high-influential information spreaders
  dominated, reaching a substantial fraction of users with fewer spreaders.
  However, when comparing domination inside the groups, the results are inverse.
  Right-leaning spreaders dominate their communities using few nodes, showing as
  the most capable of accomplishing coordinated communication. The results bring
  evidence of extreme isolation and the ease of accomplishing coordinated
  communication that characterized right-leaning communities during the 2022
  Brazilian elections, which likely influenced the subsequent coup events in
  Brasilia.
