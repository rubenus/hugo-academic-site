abstract: Real-world networks are often extremely polarized because the
  communication between different groups of vertices can be weak and, most of
  the time, only vertices within the same group or sharing the same beliefs
  communicate to each other. In this work, we introduce the minimum-cardinality
  edge addition problem (MinCEAP) as a strategy for reducing polarization in
  real-world networks based on the principle of minimum external interventions.
  We present the problem formulation and discuss its complexity, showing that
  its decision version is NP-complete. We also propose three integer programming
  formulations for the problem and discuss computational results on artificially
  generated and real-life instances. Randomly generated instances with up to
  1000 vertices are solved to optimality. In real-life instances, we show that
  polarization can be reduced to the desired threshold with the addition of a
  few edges. The minimum intervention principle and the methods developed in
  this work are shown to constitute an effective strategy for tackling
  polarization issues in practice in social, interaction, and communication
  networks, which is a relevant problem in a world characterized by extreme
  political and ideological polarization.
