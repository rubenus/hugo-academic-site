I am currently a FAPESP Research Fellow at **University of São Paulo**. I will be joining the **State University of Campinas** (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Unicamp) as a Professor at the Institute of Computing starting in December 2023. 

My research field is Computational Social Science, focusing specifically on studying human and information behavior through the analysis of **interaction networks of individuals and groups on digital platforms**. I am particularly interested in empirical analysis and mathematical modeling of online communities' behavior, polarization, radicalization, conflicts, and other similar topics. Key questions in my research are: What can we learn about people and communities from how they interact with each other through digital platforms? How do algorithms affect, and ideally can improve, both individual and social outcomes? 

In another line of research, I have studied **interaction networks of companies, institutions, and individuals** to detect fraud patterns, conflicts of interest, and collusion. These interaction networks are often created from biddings, procurement data, and other public datasets. 

If you are interested in joining my lab as a MSc or PhD student, feel free to contact me!
