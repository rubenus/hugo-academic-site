I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Computing, University of Campinas (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Unicamp). My research focuses on studying human and information behavior by analyzing **interaction networks of individuals and groups on digital platforms**. I am particularly interested in empirical analysis and mathematical modeling of the collective dynamics of human systems. Key questions in my research are: What can we learn about people and communities from how they interact with each other through digital platforms? How do algorithms affect both individual and social outcomes? In a close line of research, I have studied **interaction networks of companies, institutions, and individuals** to detect risk patterns, conflicts of interest, and collusion. These interaction networks are often created from biddings, procurement data, and other public datasets. 

If you are interested in investigating how people interact and communicate using new technologies, social networks, or scientific collaboration networks; if you are interested in modeling interaction networks between people, companies, and public entities; if you want to study the spread of opinions, viruses, or misinformation; if you like graph theory and complex networks theory - get in touch.
