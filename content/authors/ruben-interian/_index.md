I am currently a FAPESP Research Fellow at **University of São Paulo**. From 2019 to 2021, I held a Lead Data Analyst position at World Bank Group. 

My research field is Computational Social Science, focusing specifically on studying human and information behavior through the analysis of **interaction networks** of individuals and groups **on digital platforms**. I am particularly interested in empirical analysis and mathematical modeling of online communities' behavior, polarization, radicalization, conflicts, and other similar topics. A key question in my research is what we can learn about people and communities from how they interact with each other through digital platforms. 

I will be joining the **State University of Campinas** (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Unicamp) as a Professor at the Institute of Computing starting in December 2023. If you are interested in joining my lab as a MSc or PhD student, please feel free to contact me!
