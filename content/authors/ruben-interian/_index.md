I am currently a FAPESP Research Fellow at **University of SÃ£o Paulo**. From 2019-2021, I held a Lead Data Analyst position at World Bank Group. 

I will be joining the **State University of Campinas** (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Unicamp) as a tenure-track Computer Science Professor starting in December 2023. If you are interested in joining my lab as a MSc or PhD student, please feel free to contact me!
