I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Computing, University of Campinas (Unicamp). My research focuses on studying human and information behavior in large and dynamic social, political, and economic systems. I am particularly interested in empirical analysis and mathematical modeling of the structure and dynamics of interaction networks of individuals and groups on digital platforms. Key questions in my research are: What can we learn about people and communities from how they interact with each other through digital platforms? How do algorithms affect both individual and social outcomes? In a close line of research, I have studied interaction networks of companies, institutions, and individuals to detect risk patterns and conflicts of interest. 

If you are interested in investigating how people interact and communicate using new technologies, social networks, or scientific collaboration networks; if youâ€™d like to explore complex relations between people, companies, and public entities; if you want to study the spread of opinions, viruses, or misinformation; if you like graph theory and complex networks theory - get in touch.
